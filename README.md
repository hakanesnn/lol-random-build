# 🎲 LoL Ultimate Random Build Generator

**LoL Ultimate Build** is a modern, responsive web application designed to challenge League of Legends players by generating completely random—yet valid—builds for Summoner's Rift. 

Whether you're playing "Ultimate Bravery" with friends or just looking to spice up your next match, this tool provides a fresh experience every time.

## ✨ Features

- **🛡️ Random Champion Generation:** Instantly picks a random champion from the latest roster.
- **⚔️ Smart Item Builds:** 
  - Generates a full build: **1 Boots + 5 Legendary Items**.
  - **Smart Filtering:** Automatically excludes Arena-only items, Ornn upgrades, and non-Rift items (like "Demon King's Crown") to ensure every build is purchasable.
- **🔮 Full Rune Pages:** 
  - Randomizes Primary and Secondary paths.
  - Selects Keystones and minor runes.
  - Includes **Stat Shards** (Offense, Flex, Defense).
- **🔥 Summoner Spells:** Assigns two unique, valid Summoner Spells for the map (excluding mode-specific mechanics like Snowball).
- **🔄 Always Up-to-Date:** 
  - Dynamically fetches the **latest game version** (e.g., 14.x, 15.x) from Riot's [DataDragon API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol).
  - You never need to manually update the code for new champions or items!
- **🎨 Modern Hextech UI:** 
  - Glassmorphism design with a dynamic background.
  - Fully responsive for mobile and desktop.
